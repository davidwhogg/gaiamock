See the file `LICENSE` for details.

## installation:
- Try just doing
`make package-install`
and see what happens.
- It will fail, because it needs a zip file downloaded from a Caltech *Box*(tm) site.
Obey the instructions the makefile gives you.
- Once this has succeeded, you can functional-test with the notebook
`demo.ipynb`.
In addition, a simple bash submission script to run on a cluster is provided in `example_bash_submission.py`. That reproduces Fig 13 of the paper.
